# Leaderboard

A really quick example using node/express/sqlite to make an API for storing leaderboard scores.

![demo](readme_attachments/demo.gif)

## Setup

```
git clone git@github.com:chris-schmitz/leaderboard-api.git
cd leaderboard-api
npm install
npm start
```

## AN IMPORTANT NOTE!!

This is a magic bullet example, i.e. just the steps we need to prove out the general form from start to finish. Because of this there's a lot of stuff not included like authroization, validation, a client example, etc.

In its current state this codebase is just an example.

## Submitting a score

Send a post request with the following parameters

- initials (string)
- score (integer)

```

```
